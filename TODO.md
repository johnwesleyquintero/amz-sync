## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Amazon Seller Tools (Highest Priority)

**Objective:** Develop and refine the core Amazon Seller Tools to ensure they function correctly and provide immediate value to users.

**I. Tool Development & Refinement**

- **Goal:** Implement the core components and functionalities for the Amazon Seller Tools.
- **Priority:** High

  - [ ] **Reusable Tool Component:** Create a reusable component to hold the tools and their functionalities.
  - [ ] **Tool Integration:** Integrate the tools into the main component.
  - [ ] **Tool UI:** Develop a user interface for the tools.
  - [ ] **Data Handling:** Implement data fetching and processing for the tools.
  - [ ] **Security & Compliance:** Ensure the tools are secure and compliant with Amazon's API guidelines.
  - [ ] **Testing:** Test the tools thoroughly.
  - [ ] **Documentation & Support:** Document the tools and provide support.
  - [ ] **Individual Tools:**
    - [ ] FBA Calculator
    - [ ] Keyword Analyzer
    - [ ] Listing Quality Checker
    - [ ] PPC Campaign Auditor
    - [ ] Description Editor
    - [ ] Keyword Deduplicator
    - [ ] ACoS Calculator
    - [ ] Sales Estimator
    - [ ] Competitor Analyzer
    - [ ] Keyword Trend Analyzer
    - [ ] Profit Margin Calculator
  - [ ] **Tool Data Organization:**
    - [ ] Move tools to a separate file (e.g., `toolsData.ts`).
    - [ ] Add a `category` property to each tool object.
    - [ ] Create separate arrays for each tool category (e.g., `marketAnalysisTools`, `listingOptimizationTools`).
    - [ ] Define a `Tool` interface or type for consistency.
  - [ ] **Dynamic Tab Rendering:** Create a function to render tab rows dynamically based on the tools array and the desired number of tools per row.
  - [ ] **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for tool components using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
  - [ ] **UX Enhancements:**
    - [ ] **All Tools Tab:** Add an "All Tools" tab to display all tools.
    - [ ] **Category Tabs:** Implement category tabs in the UI.

    - [ ] **New Badge:** Add a "New" badge for recently added tools.
    - [ ] **Empty State:** Display a message when there are no tools in a category (empty state).
    - [ ] **Loading Indicator:** Add a loading indicator for tool components.
    - [ ] **Error Handling:** Display an error message if a tool component fails to load.
  - [ ] **Maintainability & Code Quality:**
    - [ ] **Component Decomposition:** Break down the `FeaturedToolsSection` component into smaller, more focused components (e.g., `ToolCard`, `ToolTabs`).
    - [ ] **Consistent Styling:** Use consistent styling across all tool components.
    - [ ] **Version Management:** Make the version number a variable or pull it from a configuration file.
  - [ ] **Accessibility:**
    - [ ] **ARIA Attributes:** Ensure all interactive elements have appropriate ARIA attributes.
